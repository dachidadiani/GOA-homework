  nation of Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო sakartvelo)
     was first unified as a kingdom under the Bagrationi dynasty by the King Bagrat
      III of Georgia in the early 11th century, arising from several predecess
      or states of the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia. The Kingdom of Geor
      gia flourished during the 10th to 12th centuries under King David IV the Bu
      ilder and Queen Tamar the Great, and fell to the Mongol invasion by 1243, 
      and after a brief reunion under George V the Brilliant to the Timurid Empi
      re. By 1490, Georgia was fragmented into several petty kingdoms and princi
      palities, which throughout the Early Modern period struggled to maintain 
      their autonomy against Ottoman and Iranian domination until Georgia was f
      inally annexed by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. After a brief p
      eriod of independence as Democratic Republic of Georgia, the country soon
       ended up being a Soviet Republic until the dissolution of the Soviet Uni
       on. The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991.
